# WSLg X11 socket compatibility symlink
#
# WSLg places its X11 socket at /mnt/wslg/.X11-unix but some X11 applications
# expect to find it at the standard /tmp/.X11-unix location.
#
# This creates a symlink to ensure compatibility with legacy X11 applications.
#
# Reference: Fedora WSL approach for WSLg integration

# L = symlink, path, mode, user, group, age, target
L /tmp/.X11-unix - - - - /mnt/wslg/.X11-unix
